     The routines in COMBOSUP.C are used to  help set up combo boxes.  They
     make it easy to add strings to the combo box's listbox,  and to select
     the initial listbox item.

     There are two routines provided:

          InitComboBox -                takes  an  array  of   pointers  to
                                        strings,  and  adds each  string to
                                        the listbox

          InitComboBoxFromRcStrings -   takes an array  of resource  string
                                        identifiers,   loads  the   strings
                                        corresponding  to  the identifiers,
                                        and adds the strings to the listbox

     Both of these  routines also  take a parameter  which specifies  which
     listbox entry, if any, is to be selected initially.

     These routines come compiled and linked into a DLL file, COMBOSUP.DLL.
     Library  COMBOSUP.LIB  can  be  used  for  linking,  to   establish  a
     connection to the routines in the DLL.

     COMBOSMP.C  is a sample  program which uses the  two combo box support
     routines.  It creates a standard window containing two combo boxes. It
     initializes  one combo  box  with  InitComboBox,  and the  other  with
     InitComboBoxFromRcStrings.

     COMBOSMP comes compiled and  linked into COMBOSMP.EXE.  It  expects to
     find COMBOSUP.DLL in the LIBPATH.

     These programs may be used without any restrictions.
